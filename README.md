# Calculator
This is a basic calculator made with the implementation of an expression evaluator (infix notation) in Java Swing and with the implementation of a Stack (LIFO data structure). The calculator can evaluate basic arithmetic expressions using the order of operations and parentheses.

## Features
* Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Handles parentheses to evaluate expressions correctly
* Allows input of negative numbers
* Has a simple and intuitive user interface

## Usage
To use the calculator, simply download the Calculadora1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in the main directory and run it.

## Implementation details
The calculator works by using two stacks, one for the operators and one for the operands, to evaluate the expression. A HashMap is used to assign a hierarchy to each operator, allowing the calculator to properly follow the order of operations.
